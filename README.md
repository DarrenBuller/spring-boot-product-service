# spring-boot-product-service
Spring Boot Product micro-service

This repo follows the excellent Spring Boot Microservices Tutorial tutorial by Sai, [youtube videos](https://youtube/yn_stY3HCr8?si=HAiHvepgS2GoAS30), [blog](https://programmingtechie.com/) while trying not to reference his [github repo](https://github.com/SaiUpadhyayula/spring-boot-3-microservices-course?tab=readme-ov-file)

Rather than fork the original this repo implements each chapter as a branch so that it's clear on the changes required to add each stage of functionality.
